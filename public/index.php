        <p><b><font size=4><u>But David, how do you know you're the Coolest Guy in America?</u></font></b></p>
		
		<b>Because Google says so. And Google is never wrong. Period.</b><br /><br />
        
        Before you start thinking I'm conceited, let me tell you what this site is really about.
        
		I wanted to rank a site for my first SEO project. I recognized an opportunity for both experimentation and shameless self promotion, but "Coolest Guy on the Planet" and other
		similar terms were very competitive so I decided to roll with <b>Coolest Guy in Oregon</b> as the phrase to rank for. You can check out that site here: <a href="http://www.coolestguyinoregon.com">www.coolestguyinoregon.com</a>
		</p>
		<p>
		To my surprise (about the amount of time, not about the total lack of competition or traffic), my site was first for that keyword in under 7 days. So I wanted more of a challenge. More competition than just being at the top of 35,000 pages. So I aimed higher.
		I aimed to be the top page for <b>The Coolest Guy in America</b>, a search that yields 20 million results. 
		</p>

        <h2>Wesley Risenmay is pretty cool, too</h2>
        Due to his mad golf and ping pong skills (and betting abilities), as proven during an epic, neck-in-neck golf and ping-pong championship in which <strike>he won both</strike> we tied, I crown Wesley Risenmay Co-"Coolest Guy in America."
