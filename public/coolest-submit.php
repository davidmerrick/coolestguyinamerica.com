<h2>Submit your site to Google</h2>
<p>
There are one of two ways a search engine finds your site: Through a link from another site, or by you telling it you exist.
</p>
<p>
While this is not necessary because Google will find your site if you put links elsewhere, it can't hurt.
</p>
<p>
You can submit your site to Google through their <a href="http://www.google.com/addurl/?continue=/addurl">Submission Form</a>
