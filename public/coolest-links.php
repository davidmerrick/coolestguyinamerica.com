<h2>Get Links from other Relevant Sites</h2>
<p>Backlinking is probably the most crucial factor in SEO. A great example of a site that 
ranks exclusively off of backlinking is the <a href="http://get.adobe.com/reader/">Adobe Reader Download Page.</a>
</p>
<p>
If you search Google for "click here," that site is the first one that shows up despite the fact that the phrase
"click here" is not once displayed on the page.
</p>
<p>
That being said, consider these:
<ul>
	<li>Always include your keywords in your link anchor text</li>
	<li>Bookmark your site on places like Delicious.com, Digg, etc.</li>
	<li>Put an article on ezinearticles.com or Squidoo.com with a link back to your page</li>
	<li>Press releases are a great way to get links. You can do these for $200 at places like <a href="http://www.prweb.com">PRWeb.com</a></li>
</ul>
