<h2>Announcing your site online</h2>
<p>There are several ways to do this, but the ones I prefer are<br />
<ul>
	<li>Press Releases</li>
	<li>Writing Articles</li>
</ul>
</p>
<h3>Writing Press Releases</h3>
<p>
I wrote my first press release for a client a couple weeks ago and submitted it to PRWeb. 
His site was brand-new and I hadn't built any backlinks to it other than the press release.
From the press release alone, his site now has over 1,500 backlinks and he has had over 40,000 unique visitors!

<h3>Writing Articles</h3>
