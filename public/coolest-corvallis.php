        <p><b><font size=4><u>But David, how do you know you're the coolest guy in Corvallis?</u></font></b></p>
		
		<b>Because Google says so. And Google is never wrong. Period.</b><br /><br />
        
        Before you start thinking I'm conceited, let me tell you what this site is really about.
        <p>
        A good friend introduced me to internet marketing about a year ago with Ed Dale's <a href="http://www.thirtydaychallenge.com">Thirty Day Challenge</a> Course.
		<p>
		About 3 months ago, I started getting serious about pursuing internet marketing as a both lucrative and fun career and went 
		through Brad Fallon's <a href="http://www.stompernet.net/">StomperNET SEO Training</a> course.
		</p>
		
		<p>If you do a search in Google for 
		<a href="http://www.bradfallon.com/">"Coolest Guy,"</a> Brad is ranked number one. <br /><br />
		And if you do a search for <a href="http://coolestguyontheplanet.org/">"Coolest Guy on the Planet,"</a> Jonathan Leger is number one. <br /><br />
		Mike Filsaime, another great internet marketer, is ranked second for <a href="http://www.thecoolestguyontheplanet.com/">"Coolest Guy."</a><br />
		</p>
		I recognized an opportunity for both experimentation and shameless self promotion, but "Coolest Guy on the Planet" and other
		similar terms were very competitive so I decided to roll with <b>Coolest Guy in Oregon</b> as the phrase to rank for as my 
		first SEO project. 
		</p>

		<p>
		After I was able to do that in under 7 days, I decided to rank for <b>Coolest Guy in Corvallis</b> and see how long that took. Why not?
		</p>
		
		<p>
		Check out my <a href="blog.php">Blog</a> to see where I'm at in ranking for this term.
		</p>

		Here's the process:

		<li><a href="coolest-onpage.php">Optimize On-Page</a></li>
		<li>Optimize Off-Page</li>
		<ol>
			  <li> <a href="coolest-links.php">Get links from other relevant sites</a></li>
			  <li> <a href="coolest-submit.php">Submit your site to Google</a></li>
			  <li> <a href="coolest-sitemap.php">Make a sitemap and submit it to Google</a></li>
			  <li> <a href="coolest-announce.php">Tell related sites about your site</a></li>
			  <li> <a href="coolest-directories.php">Get your site in directories</a></li>
			</ol>
		</ol>
        
        <p>
        This site is very basic, just HTML and no stylesheets or javascript. I want 
		to distill the basic and important elements of SEO for both myself 
		and anyone else reading this. For this reason, the site is 100% white hat and I'll be 100%
		transparent about how I'm ranking for it. It'll be a learning experience for myself as well as for you, the reader.
        </p>
		
		<p>
		PS: It's fitting that I should be the <b>"Coolest Guy in Corvallis"</b> because I'm a direct descendant of Joseph Avery, the pioneer who Avery park is named after and who sold several acres of land that OSU is built on.
